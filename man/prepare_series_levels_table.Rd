\arguments{
\item{code_no}{the matrix code (e.g. 2300123S)}

\item{con}{connection to the database}
}

\description{
Helper function that extracts the individual levels for each series and
gets the correct dimension id for each one and the correct series id to
keep with the constraints.
Returns table ready to insert into the `series_levels`table with the
db_writing family of functions.
