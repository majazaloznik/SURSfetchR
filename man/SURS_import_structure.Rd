\description{
Umbrella function that prepares and import all the metadata tables into
the database. This function is a bit slow because it downloads and imports
the full SURS category hierarchy, which takes a while, and i could
maybe have it already downloaded and stored, but it might change and i don't
know how often it does, and we don't insert new tables so often so for now
i'll leave it like this.
